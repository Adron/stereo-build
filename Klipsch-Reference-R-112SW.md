## The thunder down under

When the drummer in a concert video takes his solo, you want to feel the vibrations as if you were standing next to the stage. And when aliens attack in your favorite sci-fi flick, you want to feel the floor shake beneath you. Klipsch's R-112SW powered subwoofer provides your home theater with a solid foundation of bass. Its high-output 300-watt amplifier delivers the power to bring your movies, music, and video games to life.

The sub's strong-yet-light 12" Cerametallic™ woofer is designed for quick, precise movement for more accurate sound. Its ceramic-coated aluminum cone helps to dampen unwanted vibrations, while the integrated dust cap adds stability and strength to resist twisting that can cause distortion. The slot-ported cabinet features an internal flare that minimizes port turbulence and noise for cleaner bass. And the front-firing design allows for greater placement flexibility. 

### Easy system integration

Line-level and LFE (Low-Frequency Effects) inputs let you easily connect the R-112SW to almost any home theater or stereo receiver. Its back-panel volume, crossover, and phase controls help you fine-tune the bass to your liking, and blend its sound into your system. The sub comes housed in a durable MDF cabinet finished with a brushed black polymer veneer. A front-mounted LED power indicator makes it easy to tell when the sub is powered up and ready to rock.
