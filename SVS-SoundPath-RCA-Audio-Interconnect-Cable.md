## High quality, great value

The SVS SoundPath RCA Audio Interconnect Cable helps you pass a crystal-clear audio signal to your subwoofer. This mono RCA cable looks sharp with a black-and-blue cotton-braided jacket. And, in true SVS fashion, it offers a level of quality and durability usually associated with gear at a much higher price.

In this case, you don't have to pick between high-end performance and affordability. You get to have your cake and eat it, too.

### Five layers of protection

The last thing you want is for electromagnetic and radio interference to find its way running through your cables into your equipment. A messy signal nets you messy sound, so this SoundPath cable offers five-layer dielectric insulation to keep your signal nice and clean. That way your subwoofer can perform at its best.

### Gold-plated brass connectors

This sub cable's solid brass connectors are plated in 24-karat gold for enhanced conductivity and corrosion resistance. They're precisely attached using high-grade, lead-free solder for durable and consistent electrical contact.
