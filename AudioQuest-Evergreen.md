AudioQuest believes good cable design is all about damage control. In AQ's view, the perfect cable would be one that adds nothing — no noise, no distortion — to the original signal. Even AudioQuest's affordable Evergreen cables embody this philosophy. They bring together some of AQ's most advanced designs and materials, for excellent sound quality from a single joined cable that's relatively thin and lightweight.

### Solid Long-Grain Copper (LGC) conductors

One of the most important materials that goes into an audio cable is the metal used for its conductors — the parts of the cable that actually carry the signal. Unlike lesser cables, AudioQuest's Evergreen features conductors made from solid Long-Grain Copper rather than stranded metal, for improved performance and better transparency.

### Advanced cable geometry

While many cables use a single path for both the ground and shield, AudioQuest uses a design they call "double-balanced asymmetrical geometry." This design separates the ground and shield paths for clean, quiet performance.

### Cold-welded, gold-plated connectors

All the details of the cable's construction are well thought-out. For instance, the Evergreen's connectors are cold-welded, rather than soldered, which eliminates a common source of distortion found in many other audio cables.

This cable is equipped with dual RCA connectors at each end. [Mini-to-mini](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_703EGMM2M/AudioQuest-Evergreen-2-meters-6-6-feet.html) and [mini-to-RCA](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_703EGMR2M/AudioQuest-Evergreen-2-meters-6-6-feet.html) versions are also available.
