The following details collected from this page https://www.crutchfield.com/p_325VULRKES/Pangea-Audio-Vulcan-Audio-Rack-Espresso-with-Black-Posts.html from the original purchase.

## Strong, stable, and affordable

External vibrations can affect the sound quality of high-performance audio gear. Pangea Audio's Vulcan audio rack is built rock-solid to virtually eliminating unwanted vibration. And it does so at a budget-friendly price. The rack can be assembled in minutes without tools. It's also modular, so you can add extra shelves, drawers, and other accessories.

### Vibration-dampening construction

The shelves are made of 5/8"-thick vibration-dampening MDF coated in scuff-resistant vinyl. The steel support tubes bolt together with the shelves to create a strong, ultra-rigid rack. Steel spikes minimize contact with the floor â€” and its vibrations. They rest in tapered polymer cones that further dampen vibrations between the spikes and the support tubes.
