The stereo build I've put together in 2023, as I delved back into physical medium music again with vinyl & CDs is included in detail in this repository.

Mission: I'd never really collected or owned but maybe 2-3 records in my entire life. Even years ago when I collected CDs and at one time even lnoger ago, cassettes, I never stumbled into records. With this build however I wanted two things. First, I wanted to be able to play the CDs that I had - several being collectors CDs that I'd not been able to listen to in ages and ages, and music that isn't available on Spotify or such!!. Second, I wanted to delve into the world of vinyls.

With that I started looking into turn table specifications, purpose for various features, and what was going to give me the best balance of quality, features, and price point. The second thing, which is exponentially easier really from a sound quality perspective, is a CD player. Then the third thing I want to get - that had also a good balance of cost and quality, was the stereo amplifier itself.

Thus, many months ago, toward the end of 2022 I started looking into what parts I'd want for this stereo. The following, are the final set of gear and their marketing as advertised specifications as purchased from [Crutchfield](https://www.crutchfield.com/).
